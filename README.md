Django is a python framwork used for making web applications hosted on webservers,

It is a beefier version of flask and thus is used professionally

to create a django app use "python3 manage.py createapp [appname]"

to run the main server use "python3 mange.py runserver"

<hr>

### Here are some of the files that are used and why:

settings.py -> the main settings file for the whole projects

urls.py -> the "decorator bit " with flask, is used to detected when someone asks for something

models.py -> used for moving  shit around the database

views.py-> used to choose and render the html/JSX templates
